# Accessibility Testing for WPT Interop

Contributors from Apple, Mozilla, Igalia, Bocoup, Adobe, Hilton, Microsoft, Google, and many more individual web developers collaborated to kickstart a a continuous integration, interoperable, accessibility testing project in _**all major browsers**_. This collaborative effort was noted by the US [Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) CVAA Biennial Report to Congress](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-releases-2024-cvaa-biennial-report-congress) in 2024. To date, this is the only known project that stands to _**improve the state of accessibility across the entire Web**_, regardless of which platform, browser, or assistive technology you may be using or testing. It's exciting work, and we made [a lot of progress in 2023](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop-accessibility/issues/3), but there is so much more to be done! Join the effort!
